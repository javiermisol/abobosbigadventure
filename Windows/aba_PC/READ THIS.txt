=====ABOUT THE GAME=====


Abobo's Big Adventure is a project that we have been working on for YEARS as a true labor of love with one goal in mind: To create the ultimate tribute to the NES! This gargantuan 8-bit parody game is made for the fans by the fans, and now you finally have the chance to control the angriest character in the known universe - Abobo!

The story is simple - Abobo's son (Aboboy) has been kidnapped and now it's up to you to help Abobo fight his way through some of the greatest NES games of all time in order to rescue him. This isn't your average 8-bit parody game either... not only is each level a completely different game in which Abobo takes on the characteristics of the main protagonist, but enemies from a wide variety of *other* games appear on each level too! Imagine you could put every NES game ever made into a blender and that's basically what you're dealing with here in the form of a huge Flash game.

We've added in a ton of custom artwork, cutscenes, new rage moves on each level, huge boss battles, secrets, and a whopping 100 medals for you to unlock! In addition to that, we've created what we consider to be the most satisfying ending of any game you'll ever see. Sure, on classic NES games they often rewarded you with a simple "Congratulations! Game Over." after you spent hours working your way towards the end. That's not the case here - we've worked up one big ending that you'll remember for the rest of your life! Plus, when you beat the game, you'll unlock even more goodies to play with!

You'll also be happy to learn that we've created a convenient Level Select screen which automatically unlocks levels as you beat them. You don't have to beat the game in one sitting... you can always come back and use the Level Select to pick up right where you left off. You can also use it to replay any level if you need to try to unlock additional medals that you missed out on during your first play-through.

Last but not least, if you enjoy this massive game project of ours, please consider making a donation to our indie cause. We've put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into this game (mainly because Abobo kept punching us throughout its development), so your donations would be greatly appreciated and will go towards our creating future games and/or paying our hospital bills from Abobo's constant beatings. PLUS - as a token of our appreciation, anybody who makes a donation will also receive a free copy of our 100% original new mini-game, Aboboy's Small Adventure! Donate at: http://www.abobosbigadventure.com/donate.php

In closing, we'd like to thank all of our friends, families, and Newgrounds for their unwavering support over the years as we've continued to work on this huge project. It really meant the world and helped us make Abobo's Big Adventure something truly special. It's hard to imagine that this project started out all the way back in 2002... Abobo sure has come a long way with his angry fists. Thanks for playing our game and making this 8-bit dream come true.

=====UNLOCKABLES=====


Once you've beaten the game, there's still more to play! Be sure to visit the unlockables section to find some special mini-games that you have unlocked. If you beat one of the games, you'll be given access to a special Abobo's Big Adventure poster you can download!


=====TWO-PLAYER MODE=====


***Please note this contains spoilers***

While the entire game cannot be played by two players, we did include an unlockable two-player co-op mode on one level. Once you reach level 7, try entering the classic code "up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, s, a." This will enable a two-player mode so you and a friend can go to war together!


=====HINTS=====


The following information will help you in some of the areas of the game where most people seem to get stuck.

Please keep in mind that these contain spoilers and we strongly recommend trying to figure things out on your own. After all, that's what playing classic NES games was all about.


Hint #1: Should you ever encounter a mermaid, think about being nice to her. She may reward you with a special force field.

Hint #2: If you're stuck in the dungeon with seemingly nowhere you can go to get the key, there's a room with a block that is sparkling for a reason. Try pushing it in a certain direction!

Hint #3: With practice, most people can beat the balloon level without dying more than once or twice. However, if you're one of the few who simply can't beat it, you shoud know that we unveil a secret tip after you finish the level. The secret is that if you press the "1" key on your keyboard at the start of the balloon level, you will be instantly transported to the boss fight without having to beat the level.

Hint #4: When wrestling the Amazon, the best way to do damage to him is to grapple with him and then try pressing button combinations. For example: Down + A = Piledriver. These moves do far more damage than simple punches and kicks. Also, should you get tossed outside of the ring, there are chairs that you can hit him with once on the left and right sides of the ring.

Hint #5: When fighting Robobobo, save up your rage rather than using it on him. He's a relatively easy boss, and you'll want to be able to use your rage move once he's transformed into the giant Mechabobo instead.

Hint #6: When fighting Mac, dodge his attack and respond quickly with a spin punch to stun him. Once he's stunned, you can hit him with harder punches by trying different combinations. For example: Up + A = Uppercut.



Thanks again for playing!
